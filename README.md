Course-end Project 3

DESCRIPTION

Create a dynamic and responsive online food delivery web application for ordering food items of different cuisines from a restaurant.

DESCRIPTION

As a Full Stack Developer, you have to build a CI/CD pipeline to demonstrate continuous deployment and host the application on AWS EC2 instance.

 

Background of the problem statement: 

As the project is in the final stage, management has asked you to automate the integration and deployment of the web application. You are required to set up an environment where the application will be hosted and accessed by users. The source code is supposed to be fetched from a GitHub repository.

 
You must use the following: 

Eclipse

GitHub

Jenkins

AWS EC2/ Virtual machine
 

Following requirements should be met: 

A part of the source code should be tracked on the GitHub repository. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.

The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.

The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
